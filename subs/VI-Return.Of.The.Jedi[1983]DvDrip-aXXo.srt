1
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,116
Command station, this is ST-321.
Code clearance blue.

2
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,038
We're starting our approach.
Deactivate the security shield.

3
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,756
The security deflector shield
will be deactivated...

4
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,075
...when we have confirmation
of your code transmission.

5
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,315
Stand by.

6
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,557
You are clear to proceed.

7
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,875
We're starting our approach.

8
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,757
Inform the commander that
Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

9
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,915
Sir.

10
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,158
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.
We're honoured by your presence.

11
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,475
You may dispense with the pleasantries,
Commander.

12
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,989
I'm here to put you back on schedule.

13
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,032
I assure you, Lord Vader,
my men are working as fast as they can.

14
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,436
Perhaps I can find new ways
to motivate them.

15
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,553
I tell you this station will be
operational as planned.

16
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,394
The emperor does not share your
optimistic appraisal of the situation.

17
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,592
But he asks the impossible.
I need more men.

18
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,712
Then perhaps you can tell him
when he arrives.

19
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,276
- The emperor's coming here?
- That is correct, Commander...

20
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,951
...and he is most displeased with your
apparent lack of progress.

21
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,438
We shall double our efforts.

22
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,711
I hope so, Commander, for your sake.

23
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,549
The emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

24
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,115
Of course I'm worried.
And you should be too.

25
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,869
Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
never returned from this awful place.

26
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,111
Don't be so sure.

27
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,391
If I told you half the things I've heard
about this Jabba the Hutt...

28
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,317
...you'd probably short-circuit.

29
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,276
R2, are you sure
this is the right place?

30
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,236
I'd better knock, I suppose.

31
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,754
There doesn't seem to be anyone here.
Let's go back and tell Master Luke.

32
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,031
Goodness gracious me!

33
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,630
I don't think they're going
to let us in, R2.

34
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,231
We'd better go.

35
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,478
R2, wait.

36
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,197
Oh, dear. R2.

37
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,471
R2, I really don't think we should
rush into all this.

38
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,436
Oh, R2!

39
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,073
R2, wait for me!

40
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,350
Just you deliver Master Luke's message
and get us out of here.

41
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,357
Oh, my!

42
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,229
Oh, no.

43
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,519
Oh, my.

44
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,039
We bring a message to your master,
Jabba the Hutt.

45
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,716
And a gift.

46
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,114
What gift?

47
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,954
He says that our instructions are
to give it only to Jabba himself.

48
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,989
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever
so stubborn about these sort of things.

49
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,596
R2, I have a bad feeling about this.

50
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,752
Good morning.

51
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,956
The message, R2.
The message.

52
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,198
<i>Greetings, Exalted One.</i>

53
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,515
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

54
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,349
<i>I am Luke Skywalker,
Jedi knight and friend to Captain Solo.</i>

55
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,680
<i>I know that you are powerful,
mighty Jabba...</i>

56
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,315
<i>...and that your anger with Solo
must be equally powerful.</i>

57
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,069
<i>I seek an audience with Your Greatness
to bargain for Solo's life.</i>

58
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,234
<i>With your wisdom, I'm sure that
we can work out an arrangement...</i>

59
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,998
<i>which will be mutually beneficial...</i>

60
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,680
<i>...and enable us to avoid
any unpleasant confrontation.</i>

61
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,757
<i>As a token of my goodwill,
I present to you a gift...</i>

62
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,552
<i>...these two droids.</i>

63
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,477
What did he say?

64
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,990
<i>Both are hard-working
and will serve you well.</i>

65
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,715
This can't be.
R2, you're playing the wrong message.

66
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,758
He's no Jedi.

67
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,196
We're doomed.

68
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,351
R2, look. Captain Solo.

69
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,914
And he's still frozen in carbonate.

70
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,875
What could possibly have come
over Master Luke?

71
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,668
Was it something I did? He never expressed
any unhappiness with my work.

72
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,238
How horrid!

73
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,194
Good. New acquisitions.

74
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,834
You are a protocol droid,
are you not?

75
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,791
I am C-3PO...

76
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,592
Yes or no will do.

77
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,153
Well, yes.

78
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,669
How many languages do you speak?

79
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,270
I am fluent in over six million forms
of communication and can readily...

80
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,914
Splendid. We have been
without an interpreter...

81
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,237
since our master got angry
with our last protocol droid...

82
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,078
...and disintegrated him.

83
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,713
Disintegrated?

84
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,075
Guard, this protocol droid
might be useful.

85
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,270
Fit him with a restraining bolt...

86
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,597
...and take him back up to
His Excellency's main audience chamber.

87
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,075
R2, don't leave me!

88
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,071
You're a feisty little one...

89
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,555
...but you'll soon learn some respect.

90
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,831
I have need for you on
the master's sail barge...

91
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,554
...and I think you'll fill in nicely.

92
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,274
Oh, no. Chewbacca.

93
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,473
Yes, I am here,
Your Worshipfulness.

94
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,828
Yes?

95
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,597
The illustrious Jabba
bids you welcome...

96
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,188
...and will gladly pay you
the reward of 25,000.

97
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,831
"50,000. No less."

98
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,873
What did I say?

99
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,514
The mighty Jabba asks why
he must pay 50,000.

100
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,550
Because he's holding
a thermal detonator.

101
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,119
Jabba offers the sum of 35...

102
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,310
...and I do suggest you take it.

103
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,198
He agrees!

104
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,709
Just relax for a moment.

105
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,354
You're free of the carbonate.

106
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,670
You have hibernation sickness.

107
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,078
- I can't see.
- Your eyesight will return in time.

108
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,351
- Where am I?
- Jabba's palace.

109
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,078
Who are you?

110
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,235
- Someone who loves you.
- Leia.

111
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,511
I gotta get you out of here.

112
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,792
What's that?

113
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,237
I know that laugh.

114
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,188
Hey, Jabba...

115
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
Look, Jabba, I was just on my way
to pay you back.

116
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,913
I got a little sidetracked.
It's not my fault.

117
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,070
Look...

118
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,072
Jabba, I'll pay you triple.

119
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,589
You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool.

120
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,316
We have powerful friends.

121
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,590
You're gonna regret this.

122
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,832
I can't bear to watch.

123
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,239
Chewie?

124
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,837
Chewie, is that you?

125
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,188
Wait a minute.
I can't see, pal.

126
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,071
What's going on?

127
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,033
Luke? Luke's crazy.

128
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,550
He can't even take care of himself,
much less rescue anybody.

129
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,157
A Jedi knight?

130
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,629
I'm out of it for a little while,
everybody gets delusions of grandeur.

131
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,757
I'm all right, pal.

132
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,038
I'm all right.

133
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,711
I must speak with Jabba.

134
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,591
No bargain.

135
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,075
You will take me to Jabba now.

136
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,078
You serve your master well.

137
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,791
And you will be rewarded.

138
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,437
At last! Master Luke's
come to rescue me.

139
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,913
Master.

140
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,878
Luke Skywalker, Jedi knight.

141
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,918
I must be allowed to speak.

142
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,870
You will bring Captain Solo
and the Wookiee to me.

143
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,750
Nevertheless...

144
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,713
I'm taking Captain Solo
and his friends.

145
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,515
You can either profit by this
or be destroyed.

146
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,473
It's your choice, but I warn you not to
underestimate my powers.

147
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,631
Master Luke, you're standing on...

148
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,988
Oh, no! The rancor!

149
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,395
Han.

150
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,872
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Together again, huh?

151
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,309
- Wouldn't miss it.
- How are we doin'?

152
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,000
- Same as always.
- That bad, huh?

153
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,509
- Where's Leia?
- I'm here.

154
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,399
Oh, dear.

155
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,198
His High Exaltedness,
the great Jabba the Hutt...

156
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,232
...has decreed that you are to be
terminated immediately.

157
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,918
Good. I hate long waits.

158
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,708
You will therefore be taken
to the Dune Sea...

159
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,070
and cast into the Pit of Carkoon...

160
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,395
...nesting place of the
all-powerful Sarlacc.

161
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,669
Doesn't sound so bad.

162
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,509
In his belly, you will find a new
definition of pain and suffering...

163
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,598
...as you are slowly digested
over 1,000 years.

164
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,076
On second thought,
let's pass on that.

165
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,758
You should have bargained, Jabba.

166
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,795
That's the last mistake
you'll ever make.

167
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,878
I think my eyes are getting better.

168
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,992
Instead of a big dark blur,
I see a big light blur.

169
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,877
There's nothing to see.
I used to live here, you know.

170
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,719
You're gonna die here, you know.
Convenient.

171
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,035
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando.

172
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,390
I've taken care of everything.

173
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,468
Great.

174
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,588
I'm terribly sorry.

175
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,518
R2, what are you doing here?

176
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,552
I can see you're serving drinks,
but this place is dangerous.

177
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,513
They're going to execute Master Luke,
and if we're not careful, us too.

178
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,111
I wish I had your confidence.

179
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,596
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc...

180
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,712
His Excellency hopes
that you will die honourably.

181
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,988
But should any of you
wish to beg for mercy...

182
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,954
...the great Jabba the Hutt
will now listen to your pleas.

183
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,120
3PO, you tell that slimy piece
of worm-ridden filth...

184
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,754
...he'll get no such pleasure from us!

185
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,598
Right?

186
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,751
This is your last chance.

187
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,871
Free us or die.

188
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,039
Easy, Chewie.

189
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,999
Help!

190
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,596
Chewie, you're hit?
Where is it?

191
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,839
Han, Chewie!

192
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,949
Lando.

193
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,994
Boba Fett?

194
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,313
Boba Fett? Where?

195
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,071
- Lando, grab it!
- Lower it!

196
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,519
I'm trying!

197
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,069
Grab me, Chewie.
Grab it!

198
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,430
Grab it. Almost.
You almost got it.

199
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,714
Gently, now.

200
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,796
Easy. Hold me, Chewie.

201
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,559
Chewie, give me the gun.

202
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,558
- Don't move, Lando.
- Wait! I thought you were blind!

203
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,591
It's all right I can see a lot better.
Don't move.

204
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,199
A little higher!
A little higher!

205
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,151
Chewie, pull us up!

206
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,719
Up, Chewie. Up!

207
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,993
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

208
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,398
Not my eyes! R2, help!

209
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,356
Quickly, R2!

210
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,829
Beast!

211
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,752
Get the gun!

212
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,074
Point it at the deck.

213
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,879
Point it at the deck!

214
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,954
R2, where are we going?
I couldn't possibly...

215
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,359
Come on.

216
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,435
- Let's go. Don't forget the droids.
- We're on our way.

217
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,032
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

218
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,674
<i>Hurry. The Alliance should be
assembled by now.</i>

219
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,360
- I will.
<i>- Hey Luke, thanks.</i>

220
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,597
<i>Thanks for coming after me.
Now I owe you one.</i>

221
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,389
That's right, R2.
We're going to the Dagobah system.

222
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,710
I have a promise to keep...

223
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,717
...to an old friend.

224
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,199
Rise, my friend.

225
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,757
The Death Star will be
completed on schedule.

226
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,909
You've done well, Lord Vader.

227
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,637
Now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

228
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,353
Yes, my master.

229
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,634
Patience, my friend.

230
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,957
In time, he will seek you out.

231
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,312
When he does,
you must bring him before me.

232
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,635
He has grown strong.

233
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,198
Only together can we turn him
to the dark side of the Force.

234
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,992
As you wish.

235
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,394
Everything is proceeding
as I have foreseen.

236
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,512
That face you make...

237
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,994
Look I so old to young eyes?

238
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,792
No, of course not.

239
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,718
I do.

240
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,597
Yes, I do.

241
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,069
Sick have I become.

242
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,077
Old and weak.

243
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,391
When 900 years old you reach...

244
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,272
...look as good you will not.

245
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,916
Soon will I rest.

246
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,032
Yes. Forever sleep.

247
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,158
Earned it I have.

248
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,840
Master Yoda, you can't die.

249
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,920
Strong am I with the Force...

250
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,917
...but not that strong.

251
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,435
Twilight is upon me,
and soon night must fall.

252
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,798
That is the way of things...

253
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,956
...the way of the Force.

254
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,597
But I need your help.

255
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,757
I've come back
to complete the training.

256
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,916
No more training do you require.

257
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,032
Already know you
that which you need.

258
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,190
Then I am a Jedi.

259
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,432
Not yet.

260
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,471
One thing remains...

261
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,712
Vader. You must confront Vader.

262
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,439
Then, only then a Jedi will you be.

263
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,156
And confront him you will.

264
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,039
Master Yoda...

265
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,949
...is Darth Vader my father?

266
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,349
Rest I need.

267
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,833
Yes.

268
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,518
Rest.

269
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,236
Yoda, I must know.

270
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,470
Your father he is.

271
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,954
Told you, did he?

272
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,959
Yes.

273
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,915
Unexpected this is.

274
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,193
And unfortunate.

275
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,876
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

276
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,228
No.

277
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,074
Unfortunate that you
rushed to face him...

278
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,634
that incomplete was
your training...

279
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,036
...that not ready
for the burden were you.

280
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,518
I'm sorry.

281
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,959
Remember, a Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.

282
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,472
But beware.

283
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,990
Anger, fear, aggression...

284
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,634
...the dark side are they.

285
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,909
Once you start down the dark path...

286
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,635
...forever will it dominate your destiny.

287
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:50,639
Luke...

288
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,272
Do not...

289
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,552
Do not underestimate
the powers of the emperor...

290
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,910
...or suffer your father's fate you will.

291
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,156
When gone am I...

292
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,958
...the last of the Jedi will you be.

293
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,193
The Force runs strong in your family.

294
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,036
Pass on what you have learned.

295
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,198
There is...

296
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,912
another...

297
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,072
...Skywalker.

298
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,197
I can't do it, R2.

299
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,229
I can't go on alone.

300
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,430
<i>Yoda will always be with you.</i>

301
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,629
Obi-Wan.

302
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,918
Why didn't you tell me?

303
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,749
You told me Vader betrayed
and murdered my father.

304
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,159
Your father was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

305
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,034
He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader.

306
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,593
When that happened...

307
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,757
...the good man who was
your father was destroyed.

308
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,069
So what I told you was true...

309
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,952
...from a certain point of view.

310
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,435
A certain point of view?

311
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,269
Luke, you're going to find
that many of the truths we cling to...

312
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,198
...depend greatly on our own
point of view.

313
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,554
Anakin was a good friend.

314
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,993
When I first knew him...

315
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,190
your father was already a great pilot...

316
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,790
...but I was amazed how strongly
the Force was with him.

317
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,708
I took it upon myself
to train him as a Jedi.

318
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,594
I thought that I could instruct him
just as well as Yoda.

319
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,948
I was wrong.

320
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,677
There is still good in him.

321
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,439
He's more machine now than man...

322
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,437
...twisted and evil.

323
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,236
I can't do it, Ben.

324
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,191
You cannot escape your destiny.

325
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,437
You must face Darth Vader again.

326
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,233
I can't kill my own father.

327
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,318
Then the emperor has already won.

328
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,470
You were our only hope.

329
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,756
Yoda spoke of another.

330
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,188
The other he spoke of
is your twin sister.

331
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,957
But I have no sister.

332
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,871
To protect you both
from the emperor...

333
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,436
...you were hidden from your father
when you were born.

334
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,915
The emperor knew, as I did...

335
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,589
if Anakin were to have any offspring...

336
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,154
...they would be a threat to him.

337
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,354
That is the reason why your sister
remains safely anonymous.

338
00:46:03,755 --> 00:46:04,755
Leia!

339
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,588
- Leia is my sister.
- Your insight serves you well.

340
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,593
Bury your feelings deep down, Luke.

341
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,995
They do you credit...

342
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,078
...but they could be made
to serve the emperor.

343
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,200
Well, look at you.
A general, huh?

344
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,278
Someone must have told them about
my manoeuvre at the Battle of Tanaab.

345
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,153
Don't look at me, pal.
I just said you were a fair pilot.

346
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,113
I didn't know they were looking for
somebody to lead this crazy attack.

347
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,276
I'm surprised they didn't
ask you to do it.

348
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,997
Who says they didn't?
But I ain't crazy.

349
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,838
You're the respectable one, remember?

350
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,673
The emperor's made a critical error
and the time for our attack has come.

351
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,149
The data brought to us by the Bothan
spies pinpoint the exact location...

352
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,316
...of the emperor's new battle station.

353
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,158
We also know that
the weapon systems...

354
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,430
...of this Death Star
are not yet operational.

355
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,393
With the imperial fleet
spread throughout the galaxy...

356
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,953
in a vain effort to engage us...

357
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,877
...it is relatively unprotected.

358
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,956
But most important of all...

359
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,671
we've learned that
the emperor himself...

360
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,836
is personally overseeing
the final stages...

361
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,315
...of the construction
of this Death Star.

362
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,438
Many Bothans died
to bring us this information.

363
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,154
Admiral Ackbar, please.

364
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,195
You can see here the Death Star
orbiting the forest moon of Endor.

365
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,553
Although the weapon systems on this
Death Star are not yet operational...

366
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,036
...the Death Star does have
a strong defence mechanism.

367
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,475
It is protected by an energy shield...

368
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,070
...which is generated from the nearby
forest moon of Endor.

369
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,075
The shield must be deactivated
if any attack is to be attempted.

370
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,194
Once the shield is down,
our cruisers will create a perimeter...

371
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,118
while the fighters fly into
the superstructure...

372
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,073
...and attempt to knock out
the main reactor.

373
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,718
General Calrissian has volunteered
to lead the fighter attack.

374
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,068
Good luck.

375
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,517
You're gonna need it.

376
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,278
General Madine.

377
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,078
We have stolen a small imperial shuttle.

378
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,239
Disguised as a cargo ship
and using a secret imperial code...

379
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,956
...a strike team will land on the moon
and deactivate the shield generator.

380
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,274
Sounds dangerous.

381
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,595
Wonder who they found
to pull that off.

382
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,598
General Solo,
is your strike team assembled?

383
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,477
My team's ready. I don't have
a command crew for the shuttle.

384
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,591
It's gonna be rough, pal.
I didn't wanna speak for you.

385
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,748
- That's one.
- General, count me in.

386
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,711
I'm with you too.

387
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,999
- What is it?
- Ask me again sometime.

388
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,594
Hi, Han, Chewie.

389
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,035
"Exciting" is hardly the word
I would choose.

390
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,912
Look, I want you to take her.

391
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,519
I mean it. Take her.

392
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,916
You need all the help you can get.
She's the fastest ship in the fleet.

393
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,270
All right, old buddy.

394
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,311
I know what she means to you.

395
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,989
I'll take good care of her.
She won't get a scratch.

396
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,593
All right?

397
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,948
Right.

398
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,028
I got your promise.
Not a scratch.

399
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,230
Would you get going, you pirate?

400
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,035
Good luck.

401
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,593
You too.

402
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,237
- Got her warmed?
- Yeah, she's coming up.

403
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,270
I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind
when they designed her, Chewie.

404
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,037
Hey, you awake?

405
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,470
Yeah. I just got a funny feeling,
like I'm not gonna see her again.

406
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,795
Come on, General. Let's move.

407
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,117
Right. Chewie, let's see what
this piece of junk can do.

408
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,356
- Ready, everybody?
- All set.

409
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,518
Here we go again.

410
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,911
All right, hang on.

411
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,949
What is thy bidding, my master?

412
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,191
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.

413
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,471
There it will stay until called for.

414
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,679
What of the reports of the rebel fleet
massing near Sullust?

415
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,711
It is of no concern.

416
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,553
Soon the rebellion will be crushed and
young Skywalker will be one of us.

417
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,398
Your work here is finished, my friend.

418
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,080
Go out to the command ship
and await my orders.

419
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,031
Yes, my master.

420
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,032
If they don't go for this, we're gonna
have to get out pretty quick.

421
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,760
<i>We have you on our screen now.
Please identify.</i>

422
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,909
Shuttle Tydirium requesting
deactivation of the deflector shield.

423
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,239
Shuttle Tydirium,
transmit the clearance code for shield passage.

424
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,953
Transmission commencing.

425
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,958
Now we find out if that code
is worth the price we paid.

426
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,110
It'll work. It'll work.

427
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,510
Vader's on that ship.

428
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,392
Don't get jittery, Luke.

429
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,636
There are a lot of command ships.

430
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,116
Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't
look like you're keeping your distance.

431
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,675
I don't know. Fly casual.

432
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,517
Where is that shuttle going?

433
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,555
Shuttle Tydirium,
what is your cargo and destination?

434
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,436
<i>Parts and technical crew
for the forest moon.</i>

435
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,074
Do they have a code clearance?

436
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,990
It's an older code, sir,
but it checks out.

437
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,997
I was about to clear them.

438
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,790
I'm endangering the mission.
I shouldn't have come.

439
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,115
It's your imagination, kid.

440
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,879
Come on. Let's keep
a little optimism here.

441
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,079
Shall I hold them?

442
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,873
No. Leave them to me.

443
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,195
I will deal with them myself.

444
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,156
As you wish, my lord. Carry on.

445
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,757
They're not going for it, Chewie.

446
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,438
<i>Shuttle Tydirium...</i>

447
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,835
<i>...deactivation of the shield
will commence immediately.</i>

448
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,155
<i>Follow your present course.</i>

449
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,669
Okay. I told you
it was gonna work.

450
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,915
No problem.

451
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,916
I told you it was dangerous here.

452
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,030
- Should we try and go around?
- It'll take time.

453
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,038
This whole party will be
for nothing if they see us.

454
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,955
Chewie and I will take care of this.
You stay here.

455
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,640
Quietly. There might be
more of them out there.

456
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,079
Hey...

457
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,428
...it's me.

458
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,911
Go for help! Go!

459
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,473
Great. Come on!

460
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,277
Over there! Two more of them.

461
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,475
I see them. Wait. Leia!

462
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,599
Hey, wait!

463
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,995
Quick, jam their comlink.
Centre switch.

464
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,673
Move closer.

465
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,439
Get alongside that one.

466
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,196
Keep on that one.
I'll take these two.

467
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,312
General Solo, somebody's coming.

468
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,189
Where's Leia?

469
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,349
- She didn't come back?
- I thought she was with you.

470
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,869
We got separated.
Hey, we better go look for her.

471
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,912
Take the squad ahead. We'll meet
at the shield generator at 0300.

472
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,996
Come on, R2.
We'll need your scanners.

473
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,714
Don't worry, Master Luke.
We know what to do.

474
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,196
And you said it was pretty here.

475
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,837
Cut it out.

476
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,991
I'm not gonna hurt you.

477
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,280
Well, looks like I'm stuck here.

478
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,395
Trouble is, I don't know where here is.

479
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,277
Maybe you can help me.

480
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,118
Come on. Sit down.

481
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,036
I promise I won't hurt you.
Now come here.

482
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,109
All right.
You want something to eat?

483
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:22,999
That's right.

484
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,358
Come on.

485
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,079
Look. It's a hat.

486
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,077
It's not gonna hurt you. Look.

487
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,796
You're a jittery little thing,
aren't you?

488
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,359
What is it?

489
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,588
Freeze!

490
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,836
Come on. Get up.

491
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,753
- Go get your ride and take her back to base.
- Yes, sir.

492
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:01,475
What the...

493
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,308
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

494
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,353
I told you to remain
on the command ship.

495
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,551
A small rebel force has penetrated
the shield and landed on Endor.

496
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,718
Yes, I know.

497
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,316
My son is with them.

498
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,357
- Are you sure?
- I have felt him, my master.

499
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,149
Strange that I have not.

500
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,674
I wonder if your feelings
on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.

501
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,439
They are clear, my master.

502
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:39,633
Then you must go to
the sanctuary moon and wait for him.

503
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,638
He will come to me?

504
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,030
I have foreseen it.

505
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,039
His compassion for you
will be his undoing.

506
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,914
He will come to you,
and then you will bring him before me.

507
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,159
As you wish.

508
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,320
Luke? Luke?

509
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,193
Master Luke.

510
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,399
There's two more
wrecked speeders back there.

511
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,351
And I found this.

512
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,998
I'm afraid that R2's sensors
can find no trace of Princess Leia.

513
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,878
I hope she's all right.

514
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,709
What, Chewie?

515
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,032
What, Chewie?

516
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,575
I don't get it.

517
01:06:01,936 --> 01:06:03,791
It's just a dead animal, Chewie.

518
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,957
Chewie, wait! Don't!

519
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,719
Nice work.

520
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,192
Great, Chewie.

521
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,311
Great. Always thinking
with your stomach.

522
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,477
You, take it easy. Let's just figure
a way to get out of this thing.

523
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,238
Han, can you reach my lightsabre?

524
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,759
Yeah. Sure.

525
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:32,954
R2, I'm not sure that's such
a good idea.

526
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,991
It's a very long drop!

527
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,958
Hey. Point that thing someplace else.

528
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,389
Hey!

529
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,875
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

530
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,235
Chewie, give them your crossbow.

531
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,798
Oh, my head.

532
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,598
Oh, my goodness.

533
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,951
Do you understand anything
they're saying?

534
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,433
Oh, yes, Master Luke.

535
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,233
Remember that I am fluent in
over six million forms of c...

536
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,918
What are you telling them?

537
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,071
"Hello," I think.

538
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:29,112
I could be mistaken,
they're using a very primitive dialect...

539
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,630
...but I do believe they think
I am some sort of god.

540
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:41,072
Well, why don't you use your divine
influence and get us out of this?

541
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,953
I beg your pardon, General Solo,
but that just wouldn't be proper.

542
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,239
Proper?

543
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,874
It's against my programming
to impersonate a deity.

544
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,194
Why, you...

545
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,513
My mistake.

546
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,037
He's an old friend of mine.

547
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,399
Hey.

548
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,235
I have a really bad feeling about this.

549
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,913
What did he say?

550
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,270
I'm rather embarrassed,
General Solo...

551
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,756
...but it appears you are to be the main course
at a banquet in my honour.

552
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,835
Your Royal Highness.

553
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,632
These are my friends.

554
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,639
3PO, tell them they must be set free.

555
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,757
Somehow I got the feeling
that didn't help us very much.

556
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,634
3PO, tell them if they don't do
as you wish...

557
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,637
...you'll become angry
and use your magic.

558
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,035
But, Master Luke, what magic?
I couldn't possibly...

559
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,639
Tell them.

560
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,911
You see, Master Luke?
They didn't believe me...

561
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,553
...just as I said they wouldn't.

562
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,908
Wait.

563
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,997
What's happening?

564
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,838
Put me down!
Help!

565
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,439
Somebody!

566
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,834
Somebody help!

567
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,554
Master Luke!
R2! R2, quickly!

568
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,319
Thank goodness.

569
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,752
Thanks, 3PO.

570
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,837
I never knew I had it in me.

571
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,519
<i>...Tatooine...</i>

572
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,189
<i>Princess Leia... R2.</i>

573
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,679
<i>...Darth Vader!</i>

574
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,352
<i>...Death Star.</i>

575
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,390
<i>...Jedi... Obi-Wan Kenobi....</i>

576
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,557
Yes, R2, I was just coming to that.

577
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:22,835
<i>Master Luke...</i>

578
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:32,710
<i>...Millennium Falcon... Cloud City.</i>

579
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,315
<i>...Vader!</i>

580
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,514
<i>Han Solo...</i>

581
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,999
<i>...carbon.</i>

582
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,714
<i>...Sarlacc.</i>

583
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,199
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

584
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,960
Wonderful. We are now
a part of the tribe.

585
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,117
Just what I always wanted.

586
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,635
Short help's better than
no help at all, Chewie.

587
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,112
He says the scouts are going to show us
the quickest way to the shield generator.

588
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,117
Good. How far is it?

589
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,798
Ask him.

590
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,996
We need some fresh supplies too.

591
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,951
Try and get our weapons back.

592
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,516
Hurry up.
I haven't got all day.

593
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,717
Luke, what's wrong?

594
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,870
Leia, do you remember
your mother...

595
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,956
...your real mother?

596
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,436
Just a little bit.
She died when I was very young.

597
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,391
What do you remember?

598
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,988
Just images really. Feelings.

599
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,633
Tell me.

600
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,192
She was... very beautiful.

601
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,834
Kind... but sad.

602
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,593
Why are you asking me this?

603
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:37,075
I have no memory of my mother.

604
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,991
I never knew her.

605
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,790
Luke, tell me.
What's troubling you?

606
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,149
Vader is here.
Now. On this moon.

607
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,358
How do you know?

608
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:57,311
I felt his presence.

609
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,437
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near.

610
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,357
That's why I have to go.

611
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,790
As long as I stay, I'm endangering
the group and our mission here.

612
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,633
- I have to face him.
- Why?

613
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,237
He's my father.

614
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,599
Your father?

615
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,674
There's more. It won't be easy
for you to hear it, but you must.

616
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,519
If I don't make it back,
you're the only hope for the Alliance.

617
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,073
Luke, don't talk that way.

618
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:36,512
You have a power I don't understand
and could never have.

619
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,551
You're wrong, Leia.

620
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,432
You have that power too.

621
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,757
In time, you'll learn
to use it as I have.

622
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,350
The Force is strong in my family.

623
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,671
My father has it.

624
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,837
I have it.

625
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,234
And...

626
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,755
...my sister has it.

627
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,792
Yes. It's you, Leia.

628
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,398
I know.

629
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,678
Somehow...

630
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,833
...I've always known.

631
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,837
Then you know why
I have to face him.

632
01:17:27,158 --> 01:17:28,158
No!

633
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,189
Luke, run away.
Far away.

634
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:34,517
If he can feel your presence,
then leave this place.

635
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,757
- I wish I could go with you.
- No, you don't.

636
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,757
You've always been strong.

637
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,195
But why must you confront him?

638
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,869
Because there is good in him.
I've felt it.

639
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,911
He won't turn me over
to the emperor.

640
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:52,032
I can save him. I can turn him
back to the good side.

641
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,118
I have to try.

642
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,711
Hey, what's going on?

643
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,591
Nothing. I just wanna be alone
for a little while.

644
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,478
Nothing?

645
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,031
Tell me.
What's going on?

646
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,070
I can't tell you.

647
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,154
Could you tell Luke?
Is that who you could tell?

648
01:18:37,995 --> 01:18:38,995
I...

649
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:55,838
I'm sorry.

650
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,038
Hold me.

651
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,957
This is the rebel that surrendered to us.

652
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,878
Although he denies it,
I believe there may be more of them...

653
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,594
...and I request permission to conduct
a further search of the area.

654
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,234
He was armed only with this.

655
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,798
Good work, Commander.

656
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,751
Leave us.

657
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,395
Conduct your search
and bring his companions to me.

658
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,472
Yes, my lord.

659
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,276
The emperor has been expecting you.

660
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,953
I know, Father.

661
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,630
So, you have accepted the truth.

662
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,116
I've accepted the truth that you were
once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

663
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:33,312
That name no longer has
any meaning for me.

664
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,719
It is the name of your true self.
You've only forgotten.

665
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:39,038
I know there is good in you.

666
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,674
The emperor hasn't
driven it from you fully.

667
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:47,596
That was why you couldn't destroy me.

668
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,034
That's why you won't bring me
to your emperor now.

669
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,912
I see you have constructed
a new lightsabre.

670
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,233
Your skills are complete.

671
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:16,631
Indeed you are powerful,
as the emperor has foreseen.

672
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,072
Come with me.

673
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,833
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

674
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,676
You don't know the power
of the dark side.

675
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,439
I must obey my master.

676
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,756
I will not turn,
and you'll be forced to kill me.

677
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,548
If that is your destiny.

678
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:48,309
Search your feelings, Father.
You can't do this.

679
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,954
I feel the conflict within you.
Let go of your hate.

680
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,436
It is too late for me, son.

681
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,672
The emperor will show you
the true nature of the Force.

682
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,270
He is your master now.

683
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,469
Then my father is truly dead.

684
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,551
The main entrance to
the control bunker...

685
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,591
...is on the far side
of that landing platform.

686
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,910
- This isn't gonna be easy.
- Hey, don't worry.

687
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,032
Chewie and me got into a lot of places
more heavily guarded than this.

688
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,598
What's he saying?

689
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:17,917
He says there's a secret entrance
on the other side of the ridge.

690
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,591
Admiral, we're in position.
All fighters accounted for.

691
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,317
Proceed with the countdown.

692
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,835
All groups assume attack coordinates.

693
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,957
Don't worry.
My friend's down there.

694
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,514
He'll have that shield down on time.

695
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,749
Or this'll be the shortest
offensive of all time.

696
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:04,189
All craft, prepare to jump into
hyperspace on my mark.

697
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,197
All right. Stand by.

698
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,036
Back door, huh? Good idea.

699
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,913
It's only a few guards.
This shouldn't be too much trouble.

700
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,599
It only takes one to sound the alarm.

701
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:48,109
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

702
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,629
- Oh, my. Princess Leia.
- Quiet.

703
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:53,638
I'm afraid our furry companion...

704
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,796
...has gone and done something
rather rash.

705
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,957
There goes our surprise attack.

706
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:12,110
Look, over there! Stop him!

707
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:26,432
Not bad for a little furball.
There's only one left.

708
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:28,915
You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

709
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,076
I have decided that we shall stay here.

710
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,675
Hey!

711
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,873
Welcome, young Skywalker.

712
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,230
I have been expecting you.

713
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:12,117
You'll no longer need those.

714
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,157
Guards, leave us.

715
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,590
I'm looking forward
to completing your training.

716
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:34,589
In time, you will call me master.

717
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:37,075
You're gravely mistaken.

718
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,236
You won't convert me
as you did my father.

719
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,675
Oh, no, my young Jedi.

720
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:49,633
You will find that
it is you who are mistaken...

721
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,959
...about a great many things.

722
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,158
His lightsabre.

723
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:01,795
Ah, yes. A Jedi's weapon.

724
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,869
Much like your father's.

725
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,596
By now you must know your father
can never be turned from the dark side.

726
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:12,439
So will it be with you.

727
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,516
You're wrong.

728
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:17,598
Soon I'll be dead...
and you with me.

729
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:25,038
Perhaps you refer to
the imminent attack of your rebel fleet.

730
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,193
Yes.

731
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:32,235
I assure you we are quite safe
from your friends here.

732
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:36,113
Your overconfidence
is your weakness.

733
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:39,232
Your faith in your friends is yours.

734
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,116
It is pointless to resist, my son.

735
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,233
Everything that has transpired
has done so according to my design.

736
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,432
Your friends up there
on the sanctuary moon...

737
01:28:57,560 --> 01:29:01,712
...are walking into a trap,
as is your rebel fleet.

738
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,949
It was I who allowed the Alliance...

739
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,356
...to know the location
of the shield generator.

740
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,359
It is quite safe
from your pitiful little band.

741
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:17,553
An entire legion
of my best troops awaits them.

742
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:23,555
I'm afraid the deflector shield...

743
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:28,674
...will be quite operational
when your friends arrive.

744
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,354
All right!

745
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:34,913
Up! Move!
Come on!

746
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,439
Quickly. Quickly.

747
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:38,480
Chewie!

748
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,318
Han, hurry.

749
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,237
The fleet will be here any moment.

750
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,030
Charges. Come on. Come on!

751
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,832
Oh, my. They'll be captured.

752
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,238
W... Wait!
Wait! Come back!

753
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,358
R2, stay with me.

754
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,918
Freeze!

755
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:08,037
You rebel scum.

756
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,151
- All wings report in.
- Red Leader standing by.

757
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,317
- Grey Leader standing by.
- Green Leader standing by.

758
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,196
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

759
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,756
May the Force be with us.

760
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,078
We've gotta be able to get some kind of
reading on that shield, up or down.

761
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:52,240
How could they be jamming us
if they don't know...

762
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,753
...if we're coming.

763
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,236
Break off the attack.
The shield is still up.

764
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,351
I get no reading. You sure?

765
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,550
<i>Pull up!</i>
All craft pull up!

766
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,668
Take evasive action. Green Group,
stick close to Holding Sector MV-7.

767
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:15,079
Admiral, we have enemy ships
in Sector 47.

768
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,633
It's a trap.

769
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,957
Fighters coming in.

770
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,554
There's too many.

771
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:32,991
Accelerate to attack speed.
Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

772
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,109
Copy, Gold Leader.

773
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:38,833
Come, boy.

774
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,557
See for yourself.

775
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:49,114
From here, you will witness
the final destruction of the Alliance...

776
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:52,915
...and the end of your
insignificant rebellion.

777
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,190
You want this...

778
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,757
...don't you?

779
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,192
The hate is swelling in you now.

780
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:10,030
Take your Jedi weapon.

781
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:11,832
Use it.

782
01:32:11,960 --> 01:32:13,837
I am unarmed.

783
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,757
Strike me down with it.

784
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:18,314
Give in to your anger.

785
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:24,235
With each passing moment
you make yourself more my servant.

786
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:30,319
No.

787
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,516
It is unavoidable.

788
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,596
It is your destiny.

789
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:39,592
You, like your father...

790
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,278
are now...

791
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,718
...mine.

792
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,350
All right, move it.

793
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,598
Hello. I say, over there.

794
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,590
Were you looking for me?

795
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:18,836
Bring those two down here.

796
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:30,278
They're on their way.
R2, are you sure this was a good idea?

797
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,674
Freeze.

798
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,869
Don't move.

799
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,831
We surrender.

800
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,157
The code's changed.

801
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,555
- We need R2.
- Here's the terminal.

802
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,591
R2, where are you?

803
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,597
We need you at the bunker
right away.

804
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,033
Going?
What do you mean you're going?

805
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,238
Going where, R2?

806
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:54,399
No, wait!
R2, this is no time for heroics!

807
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:56,112
Come back!

808
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,998
Watch yourself, Wedge.
Three from above.

809
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,918
- Red Three, Red Two, pull in.
- Got it.

810
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,712
Three of them coming in, 20 degrees.

811
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,478
Cut to the left.
I'll take the leader.

812
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,152
They're heading for the medical frigate.

813
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,109
Pressure's steady.

814
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:00,071
Only the fighters are attacking.
What are the Stardestroyers waiting for?

815
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:06,158
We're in attack position now, sir.

816
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:09,317
- Hold here.
- We're not going to attack?

817
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,591
I have my orders from the emperor himself.
He has something special planned.

818
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:14,551
We only need to keep them
from escaping.

819
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,113
As you can see,
my young apprentice...

820
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:23,357
...your friends have failed.

821
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:26,395
Now witness the firepower...

822
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:31,640
...of this fully armed
and operational battle station.

823
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,194
Fire at will, Commander.

824
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:43,558
Fire.

825
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,354
That blast came from the Death Star.

826
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,510
That thing's operational.

827
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,392
Home 1, this is Gold Leader.

828
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,511
We saw it.
All craft prepare to retreat.

829
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,756
You won't get another
chance at this, Admiral.

830
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,519
We have no choice, General Calrissian.

831
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:07,791
Our cruisers can't repel firepower
of that magnitude.

832
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:11,469
Han will have that shield down.
We've gotta give him more time.

833
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,873
We're coming.

834
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:37,794
Come on.

835
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:42,759
R2, hurry!

836
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,470
My goodness!

837
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:57,231
Why did you have to be so brave?

838
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,714
Well, I suppose I could
hot-wire this thing.

839
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,239
I'll cover you.

840
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,475
Yes, I said closer.
Move as close as you can...

841
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:49,194
...and engage those Stardestroyers
at point-blank range.

842
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:52,596
At that close range, we won't last long
against those Stardestroyers.

843
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,234
We'll last longer than we will
against that Death Star...

844
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,510
...and we might take
a few of them with us.

845
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,594
She's gonna blow!

846
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,033
I'm hit!

847
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,070
Your fleet is lost...

848
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:18,079
...and your friends on the Endor moon
will not survive.

849
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,589
There is no escape...

850
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:25,234
...my young apprentice.

851
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,715
The Alliance will die...

852
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,239
...as will your friends.

853
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:38,948
Good.

854
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,037
I can feel your anger.

855
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:48,076
I am defenceless.
Take your weapon.

856
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:51,192
Strike me down with
all of your hatred...

857
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:55,632
...and your journey towards
the dark side will be complete.

858
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,276
- Look!
- Get him off of there.

859
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,711
I think I got it.

860
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,034
I got it!

861
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,268
Are you all right?

862
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:37,197
- Let's see.
- It's not bad.

863
01:43:37,320 --> 01:43:38,548
- Freeze!
- Oh, dear.

864
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,113
Don't move.

865
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,994
- I love you.
- I know.

866
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:48,394
Hands up.

867
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,629
Stand up.

868
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,479
Stay back.

869
01:44:06,799 --> 01:44:07,799
Chewie?

870
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,674
Get down here.
She's wounded.

871
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,552
No, wait.

872
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,193
I got an idea.

873
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,473
Good.

874
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:31,229
Use your aggressive feelings, boy.

875
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,954
Let the hate flow through you.

876
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:42,836
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

877
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,435
I will not fight you, Father.

878
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:04,633
You are unwise
to lower your defences.

879
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,869
Your thoughts betray you, Father.

880
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,992
I feel the good in you, the conflict.

881
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:36,475
There is no conflict.

882
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:40,637
You couldn't bring yourself
to kill me before...

883
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,637
...and I don't believe
you'll destroy me now.

884
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:47,117
You underestimate the power
of the dark side.

885
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,992
If you will not fight...

886
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,588
...then you will meet your destiny.

887
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:03,749
Good.

888
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,233
Good.

889
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:17,030
- Watch out. Squad at .06.
- I'm on it, Gold Leader.

890
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,233
Good shot, Red Two.

891
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:26,678
We're sure in the middle of it now.
Come on, Han, old buddy.

892
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,392
Don't let me down.

893
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,159
<i>It's over, Commander.</i>

894
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,510
<i>The rebels have been routed.
They're fleeing into the woods.</i>

895
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:39,074
<i>We need reinforcements
to continue the pursuit.</i>

896
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:41,997
Send three squads to help.

897
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:43,997
- Open the back door.
- Sir.

898
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,953
Throw me another charge.

899
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:18,473
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

900
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,511
I will not fight you.

901
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,792
Give yourself to the dark side.

902
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:33,199
It is the only way
you can save your friends.

903
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:35,838
Yes.

904
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:37,837
Your thoughts betray you.

905
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:40,394
Your feelings for them are strong...

906
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,317
especially for...

907
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:45,992
...sister.

908
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:51,352
So you have a twin sister.

909
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:55,029
Your feelings have now
betrayed her too.

910
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:59,073
Obi-Wan was wise to
hide her from me.

911
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:03,398
Now his failure is complete.

912
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:08,469
If you will not turn
to the dark side...

913
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:11,273
...then perhaps she will.

914
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,276
Never!

915
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,678
Good!

916
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:04,434
Your hate has made you powerful.

917
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:10,356
Now, fulfil your destiny...

918
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,393
...and take your father's place
at my side.

919
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:30,114
Never.

920
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,110
I'll never turn to the dark side.

921
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:40,679
You've failed, Your Highness.

922
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,677
I am a Jedi...

923
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,756
...like my father before me.

924
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:55,350
So be it, Jedi.

925
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:57,357
Move! Move!

926
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:13,189
The shield is down. Commence attack
on the Death Star's main reactor.

927
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:16,915
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group,
all fighters follow me.

928
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,871
I told you they'd do it.

929
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,234
If you will not be turned...

930
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:31,557
...you will be destroyed.

931
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:39,953
Young fool.

932
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,594
Only now, at the end...

933
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,517
...do you understand.

934
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:03,718
Your feeble skills are no match
for the power of the dark side.

935
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:11,075
You have paid the price
for your lack of vision.

936
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,192
Father, please!

937
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,950
Now, young Skywalker...

938
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,752
...you will die.

939
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:59,519
I'm going in.

940
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:03,709
Here goes nothing.

941
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:14,229
Lock onto the strongest power source.
It should be the power generator.

942
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:19,670
Form up. Stay alert.
We could run out of space real fast.

943
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,631
Split up and head back to the surface.

944
01:53:36,760 --> 01:53:39,797
See if you can get a few of those
TIE fighters to follow you.

945
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,830
Copy, Gold Leader.

946
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,233
That was too close.

947
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,150
We've got to give
those fighters more time.

948
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:01,192
Concentrate all fire on that
Super Stardestroyer.

949
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:09,116
Sir, we've lost our
bridge deflector shields.

950
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:12,118
Intensify the forward batteries.
I don't want anything to get through.

951
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,192
Intensify forward firepower!

952
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:19,109
Too late!

953
01:55:00,839 --> 01:55:01,839
Luke...

954
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:06,069
...help me take this mask off.

955
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,997
But you'll die.

956
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:12,196
Nothing can stop that now.

957
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:14,798
Just for once...

958
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,278
let me...

959
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:20,710
...look on you with my own eyes.

960
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:59,678
Now go, my son.

961
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,673
Leave me.

962
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:06,075
No. You're coming with me.

963
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,430
I'll not leave you here.
I've got to save you.

964
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:12,829
You already have, Luke.

965
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:15,757
You were right.

966
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:18,750
You were right about me.

967
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,318
Tell your sister...

968
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:25,436
...you were right.

969
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,275
Father.

970
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,714
I won't leave you.

971
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:04,075
There it is.

972
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:09,195
All right Wedge, go for the power
regulator on the north tower.

973
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:12,471
Copy, Gold Leader.
I'm already on my way out.

974
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:33,912
Move the fleet away from
the Death Star.

975
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:20,792
They did it!

976
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:31,229
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing
when it blew.

977
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:34,672
He wasn't.

978
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,392
I can feel it.

979
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:42,393
You love him.

980
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:47,033
Don't you?

981
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:48,559
Yes.

982
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:51,274
All right. I understand.

983
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:52,719
Fine.

984
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:55,438
When he comes back...

985
01:58:56,480 --> 01:58:58,152
...I won't get in the way.

986
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,637
It's not like that at all.

987
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:08,430
He's my brother.

988
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,438
Wesa free!
